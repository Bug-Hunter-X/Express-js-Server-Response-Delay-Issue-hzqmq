# Node.js Express.js Server Response Delay

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js Express.js applications where a delay in the response handling can lead to unexpected behavior.  The example shows a server that introduces a 5-second delay before sending a response. This delay can cause client-side timeouts and negatively impact the user experience.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to address this issue by implementing proper timeout handling and asynchronous operation management.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
5. Make a request to `http://localhost:3000/` using a tool like curl or a web browser. Observe the delay.

## Solution

The solution involves careful consideration of asynchronous operations and potential timeouts. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates one approach to resolve this problem.
